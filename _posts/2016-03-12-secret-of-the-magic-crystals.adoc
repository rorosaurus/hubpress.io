##Setting the stage\n\nOn July 20th, 2012 I started an experiment.  Steam was running their Summer Sale, and I noticed that [Secret of the Magic Crystals](http://store.steampowered.com/app/45100/) was on sale for $0.99.  It seemed like an opportunity ripe for exploiting.\n\n![Store Page](/content/images/2016/03/store-page.png)\n\nI created the following challenge, posted publicly on my Steam profile, and began to coerce friends to consider the task.\n\n![Secret of the Magic Crystals Challenge](/content/images/2016/03/challenge.PNG)\n\nNow you can probably tell from the Store page screenshot how terrible this game might be to play.  I assure you, it's much worse than you imagine.  To learn a bit more about how agonizingly painful this challenge is, here's a short description from the Steam Store:\n\n>In this game you manage a horse-breeding farm set in a fantasy surrounding. The game enables you to breed legendary horses such as Pegasus, Unicorn, Fire-steed, Ice-steed and Demon-steed. You can buy over 700 objects during the game. Make all kinds of horseshoes as well as lots of magical potions for your horses.\n\nThe game is rated by the ESRB as EC, for Early Childhood.  The entire game is a terribly boring grind of training horses to higher levels to breed them and accomplish more difficult quests.\n\n![Rated EC by ESRB](/content/images/2016/03/esrb_ec.gif)\n\nI eventually gifted this game to a grand total of 33 friends, 22 of which launched it at some point in time and attempted to unlock all the achievements.  11 friends were not swayed by my challenge, yet accepted the game into their Steam inventory anyway: forever publicly immortalizing their interest in young children's pony games on their Steam Community profiles.\n\n##The Grind\n\nOf the 22 who tried to complete the challenge, most gave up after 1-3 hours.  A select few made it an impressive 6-7 hours in before realizing the sheer effort they would need to commit.  One friend even made it nearly 12 hours!  Yet ultimately, every one gave up.  \"The game is too childish,\" they said.  \"The grind is too much.  It cannot not be done.\"\n\nOff and on the challenge was attempted, until finally in June 2014 it looked like we might have a champion!  She logged nearly 40 hours in the game, and was the first to find one of the Magic Crystals!  Sadly, this discovery revealed that this process must be repeated 4 additional times, and our heroine began to despair and eventually stopped playing.  She, too, conceded that it could not be done.\n\nMuch time passed with no progress on the challenge.  These were dark times.  I began to lose hope that anyone would ever complete the challenge.  Surely there must be someone out there who has the mental fortitude to subject themselves to this!\n\n###I am pleased to write today that such a hero has come.\n\nOn March 10th, 2016 at 11:23pm PST, my friend GrindFox got his 22nd and final achievement - completing this challenge in an incredible 37.6 hours over just two short weeks!  I never would have expected that the challenge would be completed so quickly - this is truly an impressive display of human determination!\n\n![22 of 22 (100%) Achievements Earned](/content/images/2016/03/achievements-earned.PNG)\n\nAs I'm sure many of you are dying to know, he was kind enough to finally reveal to us the secret of the magic crystals.  ==Spoilers ahead!==  The final moments of the game are presented in three still slides: [one](/content/images/2016/03/ending-1.jpg), [two](/content/images/2016/03/ending-2.jpg), and [three](/content/images/2016/03/ending-3.jpg).  I am told the story ending is not worth the effort required to reach it.\n\n##And now, some numbers:\n\n* I purchased 39 copies of the base game and 5 DLC, for a **total cost of $58.29**.\n* My friends played a **total of 120.4 hours** of this game.\n* Using these values, I conclude that *I can effectively force my friends to play a child's pony game for approximately $0.48 per hour*.\n\nAt some point I tried the challenge myself, but only made it 1.3 hours before I was broken. I only got one achievement.  Grindfox has my admiration and respect for his courage and perseverance.\n\nFor his prize, he chose Blizzard's new team-based FPS: [Overwatch](https://playoverwatch.com/)!\n\nUltimately, I consider this experiment a resounding success!  I would like to thank everyone who participated!
