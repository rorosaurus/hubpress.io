You might call them drones.  I call them quadcopters or multirotors.  But as much as I hate using the word, \"drones\" is the easiest way to describe what I'm talking about, even if it's not *technically* accurate.\n\nThis is a pretty big topic, so this won't be my last post regarding this topic.  This post will serve more as an introduction with some basic recommendations for getting started.  As always, feel free to email me if you have any questions!\n\n#First things first\nFPV, or first-person-view, drones are what people typically use for racing or freestyling.  These are fast, agile, drones which usually have a short battery life.  The camera is usually fixed, not gimbaled, so video footage is not cinematic or smooth.  There is no intelligence or automatic stabilization on these drones.  The drone does exactly what you tell it to do.\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5SVwCKe6PkE\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nAerial photography drones are slower and less maneuverable.  They have longer flight times and produce smooth, cinematic video.  They auto stabilize based on GPS, additional onboard cameras, etc. and they smooth out your inputs to produce a better video (and easier to control drone).  You *can* see the video feed from these drones, but it's often delayed a troublesome amount.\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/NsHp5iMyNYE\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nThese can also be fun to fly, but today I'm going to focus on FPV drones.\n\nFPV drones don't have a million gauges and modes to monitor and learn.  You just look through the camera and fly free as a bird!  The feeling is infectious and liberating!  FPV drones are simply **fun** to operate.\n\n#Quick Disclaimers\n\n``Please make the effort to educate yourself on local, state, and federal laws and policies regarding drones/UAVs.  Help educate others on drones and their exciting potential - and always take care to respect the safety and privacy of others.``\n\nIf you live in the USA, start your research at [faa.gov](https://www.faa.gov/uas/getting_started/).  Read [their FAQ for recreational drone use](https://www.faa.gov/uas/faqs/#ffr).  They have a [free smartphone app](https://www.faa.gov/uas/where_to_fly/b4ufly/) you can use to confirm where it's legal to fly.\n\nI should also mention that drones (specifically heavy or fast ones) **can be dangerous if not used properly**.  The batteries can explode and start fires if you don't treat them properly, the propellers will cut flesh as easily as air, and of course a 1kg ball of carbon fiber hurts when it hits you at 80 miles per hour.\n\nThe \"micro\" quad I recommend below is slow and light.  The propellers are ducted (protected on the sides), and are held by a simple snug fit (so they pop off easily).  The batteries are small enough that abuse/misuse is not a major concern, and the plastic frame is forgiving on crashes (or if you bump into someone).  Just be careful not to get long hair stuck in the propellers!  It weighs ~25 g, which is MUCH less than the 0.55 lbs after which you'd need to register with the FAA.\n\n#Simulators: the best way to practice\n\nThese simulators are the best way to start, hands down.  Crash recovery, swapping/charging batteries, signal strengths, building and assembly - forget about all of it and just fly!  It's a little strange to fly at first, since you're moving through a fluid with no traction.  Grab an Xbox controller and practice on these before you risk breaking/losing actual equipment!\n\nIn no particular order:  \n\n* [Drone Racing Simulator](http://thedroneracingleague.com/simulator/) - Free\n* [Hotprops](http://www.hotprops-fpv-race.com/) - Free\n* [FPV Freerider](https://fpv-freerider.itch.io/fpv-freerider) - Free demo, $5\n* [Liftoff](http://www.liftoff-game.com/) - $20\n* [VelociDrone](http://www.velocidrone.com/) - Free demo, £20\n* [FPV Event](http://www.dronesimulation.co.uk/pilot.html) - Free trial, £40\n* [Rotor Rush](http://rotorrush.com/) - £4 per month\n* [FPV Drone Racing Mod](https://www.gta5-mods.com/scripts/fpv-drone-racing) for [Grand Theft Auto V](http://www.rockstargames.com/V/) - Free, if you own GTA5\n\n#Cheap, low-commitment entry into the FPV hobby\n\nThe following is my recommendation for a low cost, but **very** fun starter FPV drone.  You can be flying FPV for less than $100!  With a few upgrades, you can even join local races!\n\nIt's called a Tiny Whoop!  Check out [the official website](https://www.tinywhoop.com/) for more info.  I'd encourage you to buy from that website directly if you want to support the creators.  My recommendation below is a Chinese knockoff which is a lot cheaper.\n\nCurious how it will look and fly?  There's [hundreds of videos on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=tiny+whoop)!\n\n###Eachine E010C ([Banggood.com](http://www.banggood.com/Eachine-E010C-Micro-FPV-Raicng-Quadcopter-With-800TVL-40CH-25MW-CMO-Camera-45C-Battery-p-1110786.html), [Amazon.com](https://smile.amazon.com/EACHINE-Racing-Quadcopter-800TVL-Camera/dp/B01N2408PB/))\n\nFor less than $40 USD, you can get this cheap Chinese clone of the [Inductrix](http://www.bladehelis.com/Inductrix/), with a camera and video transmitter built-in!  This is a very fun and very durable lightweight micro-quad you can fly indoors worry-free.  I'd recommend buying some [extra batteries](http://www.banggood.com/5PCS-Eachine-E010-3_7V-150MAH-45C-Upgrade-Battery-USB-Charger-Set-RC-Quadcopter-Spare-Parts-p-1103569.html) for it so you don't have to wait for it to recharge.  Buy a receiver below to fly it FPV (first-person-view)!  You can remove the camera and fly it LOS (line-of-sight), or you can [buy a cheaper version that comes with no camera](http://www.banggood.com/Eachine-E010-Mini-2_4G-4CH-6-Axis-Headless-Mode-RC-Quadcopter-RTF-p-1066972.html).  You probably want the Mode 2 (Left Hand Throttle) version.\n\n#Receivers to watch and record the video stream\n\nThat camera is blasting out 25mW of analog video somewhere on 5.8GHz!  You need a receiver hooked up to a display to watch it, and a DVR of some sort if you want to record the footage you receive.  Some people use Goggles, but that's usually more expensive or requires a special battery charger.\n\n###5.8G 32CH OTG FPV Receiver ([Banggood.com](http://www.banggood.com/5_8G-32CH-OTG-FPV-Receiver-for-Smart-Phone-PC-Monitor-p-1119506.html))\nThis is probably the cheapest way to receive the FPV video stream.  It also has DVR and scanning functionality (you don't have to manually find the right band/channel).  You'll need an Android device to plug this into.  If you don't have that, I would recommend one of the below standalone monitors instead, which cost a bit more.  Tip: You can use this with Google cardboard to make very cheap FPV goggles!\n\n###Eachine LCD5800D ([Banggood.com](http://www.banggood.com/Eachine-LCD5800D-5_8G-40CH-7-Inch-HD-FPV-Monitor-With-DVR-Built-in-Battery-p-1067081.html))\nGood price, DVR, no need for a fancy battery charger!  This is the best deal for a standalone monitor, in my opinion, if it's available!  Check out the LCD5802D if this is sold out.\n\n###Eachine LCD5802D ([Banggood.com](http://www.banggood.com/Eachine-LCD5802D-5802-5_8G-40CH-7-Inch-FPV-Monitor-with-DVR-Build-in-Battery-p-1029504.html), [Amazon.com](https://smile.amazon.com/EACHINE-LCD5802D-Monitor-Receiver-Battery/dp/B01ANOOJ3Q/))\nThese Eachine monitors (or some similar product - just search for \"FPV Monitor\") will receive the video signal and display it - it's all self-contained.  It can also save the received video to a microSD card using the built-in DVR.  It comes with it's own charger and a scan button to find the right channel for the video!  This model is a bit more expensive because it has two antenna for receiving.\n\n###Eachine EV800 FPV Goggles ([Banggood.com](http://www.banggood.com/Eachine-EV800-5-Inches-800x480-FPV-Goggles-5_8G-40CH-Raceband-Auto-Searching-Build-In-Battery-p-1053357.html), [Amazon.com](https://smile.amazon.com/EACHINE-800x480-Goggles-Raceband-Auto-Searching/dp/B01FDGN8LI/))\nI think these are a great deal, especially if they're on sale.  I haven't tried them, but the reviews are promising.  Built-in battery which doesn't need a special charger!  Search feature!  Can detach into a FPV Monitor to show your friends!  Only thing it's missing is [a DVR](http://www.banggood.com/Eachine-ProDVR-Pro-DVR-Mini-Video-Audio-Recorder-for-FPV-Multicopters-p-1061196.html), but you can [add that later](https://downanddirtydrones.com/2016/10/02/add-a-dvr-to-the-eachine-ev800/) if you decide you want it (some soldering required).\n\n###Virhuck T909 FPV Watch ([Amazon.com](https://smile.amazon.com/Virhuck-Receiver-Monitor-Antenna-Transmission/dp/B01ID9JYKG/))\nWhy does this thing exist?  I don't know, but it's dirt cheap and actually seems to work quite well!  Downsides: the tiny screen makes it hard to see everything, and there's no DVR to record.\n\n#Caveats of this drone recommendation\n\nThis isn't a perfect quad.  All the above items are chosen to minimize effort and additional spending (battery chargers, controllers, etc.) while maximizing what you get for the money.  Potential problems include:\n\n* This drone is tiny and very easily blown around by wind.  It will be the most fun indoors.  Do not go very high outside - the wind will carry your drone away. ;)\n* The controller is difficult to use.  There are some [cheap replacement joysticks](http://www.banggood.com/FQ777-124-Pocket-Drone-Spare-Parts-Two-RC-Sticks-p-1000313.html) you could buy which would make it much easier to be more precise.\n* The black wire sticking out on the drone's circuit board is the receiving antenna for control of the drone.  Make sure it's tucked away safely where it will not hit the propellers.\n* For maximum fun (after you get comfortable flying it), motors would need to be replaced with more powerful motors.\n  * And if you replace the motors, you probably also want to replace the flight controller (the circuit board).\n  * And the the remote control too.\n  * If you give a mouse a cookie...\n* **Don't abuse the batteries.  When the lights flash indicating the battery is low, stop flying.**  Continuing to fly will totally destroy the battery's ability to hold a charge.\n* Ideally, you'd want bigger batteries.  If you start to get serious about this, you'll want to use 200mAh 1S LiPo's with Micro JST connector (or PowerWhoop connector).\n  * [Here is a treasure trove of data](https://sites.google.com/view/rchobbylocker/1s-lipo-testing) examining different battery options.\n* If you need replacement parts, just [search \"E010\" on Banggood.com](http://www.banggood.com/search/e010.html)!\n* Most people prefer to fly FPV using goggles instead of a handheld screen, since this is more immersive and reduces glare/distractions.\n  * Goggles are more expensive and also require special chargers and receivers, so I don't consider them ideal for a low cost \"testing the water\" investment.\n* Drones are the one device where **I highly recommend reading and keeping the manual!**\n * Take a picture and save it somewhere - I guarantee you'll want to look something up next month.\n\n#Next steps\n* Fly!  Recharge!  Fly again!\n* Get comfortable with the simulator and E010 in auto-level mode.\n* Learn how to fly the simulator and E010 in airmode or \"acro\" mode, where it does not automatically keep itself flat.\n\nIn the future, I'd like to make a couple of posts about building your own FPV drone from scratch, LiPos and proper battery care, and a few other topics.  For the time being, however, I'll leave you with this excellent YouTube video which explains the different components that go into a remote controlled aircraft.\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/j61Q3e8AFR4\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>
